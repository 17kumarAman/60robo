                <p class="mt-5 font-sans ">In 2016, after Rob Preston and Jon Robinson spent two years developing SamCart
                    into a massively successful SaaS product, they founded 64 Robots. The goal for 64 Robots, which has
                    since become a reality, was to utilize experience and passion for great ideas to help the next
                    generation of startups and web-based companies develop their vision into something incredible.</p>
                <p class="mt-5 font-sans ">64 Robots is a full-service software agency specializing in leading-edge,
                    user-forward web solutions. Our team is made up of expert-level developers, designers, and project
                    managers from all across the globe. We’re a collaborative bunch—priding ourselves on building
                    partnerships with our clients and providing full transparency at each stage of every project lifecycle.

                <p class="text-center ">Our process for UX/UI Design focuses on distilling complex ideas into
                    easy-to-understand diagrams,

                    (frontend), Flutter (mobile apps), and AWS cloud (hosting). 64 Robots partners with each of these

                <p class="text-center ">For mobile app development, we use the Google Flutter framework, which provides a
                    clean, modern way of
                    building mobile applications with an extensive library of components to layout each page.</p>

                    wireframing process, to
                    delivery, we design every screen from login to logout. Alongside your brand guidelines we match each
                    button, paragraph, and icon down to the pixel.</p>

                    data in sync as needed.
                    Some examples of APIs we’ve worked with are Google, Facebook, Okta, Stripe, and Salesforce.</p>
